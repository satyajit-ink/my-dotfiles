# TODO

Clean the Install Script and make it more generic (so it works on all my ubuntu machines, and i can setup all my stuff easily)

Add these following to my install script

- `nvm` (Node Version Manager) so i can install the latest version easily
- use a nice OpenGL Based Terminal
- make sure the terminal fallbacks the fonts if fonts are not supported ?

Also i need to add scripts like to build docker containers, launch jupyter lab on ssh machines so i can easily use them without that long command i always have to type

Become more familiar with `tmux` ?
