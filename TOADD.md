# TODO

Clean the Install Script and make it more generic (so it works on all my ubuntu machines, and i can setup all my stuff easily)

Add these following to my install script

- nvm (Node Version Manager) so i can install the latest version easily
- use a nice OpenGL Based Terminal
- make sure the terminal fallbacks the fonts if fonts are not supported ?
